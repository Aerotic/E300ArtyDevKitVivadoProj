WARNING: [DRC DPOP-1] PREG Output pipelining: DSP E300ArtyDevKitPlatform/sys/tile/core/div/_T_84 output E300ArtyDevKitPlatform/sys/tile/core/div/_T_84/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
WARNING: [DRC DPOP-1] PREG Output pipelining: DSP E300ArtyDevKitPlatform/sys/tile/core/div/_T_84__0 output E300ArtyDevKitPlatform/sys/tile/core/div/_T_84__0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0).

WARNING: [DRC DPOP-2] MREG Output pipelining: DSP E300ArtyDevKitPlatform/sys/tile/core/div/_T_84 multiplier stage E300ArtyDevKitPlatform/sys/tile/core/div/_T_84/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.

WARNING: [DRC IOSR-1] IOB set reset sharing: IO jd_4 connects to flops which have these E300ArtyDevKitPlatform/sys/dtm/JtagTapController/stateMachine/currStateReg/reg_0/irChain_io_chainIn_capture, and E300ArtyDevKitPlatform/sys/dtm/JtagTapController/stateMachine/currStateReg/reg_3/idcodeChain_io_chainIn_capture set/reset signals.  For optimal IOB flop packing there should be only one set/reset signal coming into the IOB.
